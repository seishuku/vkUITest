# vkUITest

Testing out some experimental UI type code.<br>
his version renders using Vulkan, but can literally be rendered with anything, just needs to be implemented in the draw function.<br><br>
Linux should work, though WSL doesn't seem to handle raw motion Xi extensions, but it did work in testing on native Linux (Arch).<br>
Android should now be supported, but rotation is pretty broken, so it's a definite work-in-progress.
